     <p>The <em>bunny</em> is awesome because <strong>its adorable.</strong> They are fuzzy and snuggly- which already gives them an advantage- and on top of that they hop all over the place! i really would like a pet bunny one day. I've been told by friends that I remind them of a bunny and with my jumpy personality and I'm not too surprised to hear that. To make it better, bunnies are one of the official animals to be associated with the moon- and my name means moon! Therefore, bunnies are the greatest.
